<h1>HOW TO USE?</h1><br>

First add a list, which will represent a specific category of tasks. The input will accept any characters but will give an error if the field is left empty on submit.<br>

Once a list is created, you can add individual task "cards" that fall into that list category.<br>

once complete you can either mark complete or delete the task.<br>

This was my first practice project using React :grin:. I am currently still learning React and at the time of working on the project was using various resources like Youtube and Udemy to learn basic react skills and then taking them and implementing in my own project. 

I wanted to base this project off of the Kanban style organization lists found on https://trello.com/en.

At the time of writing, my project does not nearly have as much functionality as Trello :sweat_smile: but I thought the idea of creating lists and creating tasks inside the list would be a perfect implementation of React, and I later came to realize that Trello was also created using React :thumbsup:. You can find the project here hosted here https://brello.netlify.app/.

Things to improve on*

- I would like to find a way to speed up the application, I am finding that the imgs take a little long to load. 
- I attempted to implement a search bar in the project and the search did work using .filter(), however, I was running into the issue of the imgs were reloading into different imgs and if the list had a card, it would repopulate without any of its cards. 

As of right now (08/03/2021) I will be calling this project complete as id like to move on to other projects to keep practicing my skills, however, I may return to this project later on to implement the above improvements and possibly adding a backend to the project with a login system.
